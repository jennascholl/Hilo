# Overview

In order to further my learning as a software engineer, I decided to make a basic program using Java. This program demonstrates the use of variables, expressions, conditionals, loops, functions, classes, and data structures.

The program I chose to create to demonstrate the Java language is a console game called Hilo. The game draws a card from a deck, presents it to the user, and allows the user to guess whether the next card drawn will be higher or lower. The game continues until the player decides to quit.

My purpose in writing this software is to demonstrate the application of basic foundational concepts in the Java language.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

In order to develop this software, I used IntelliJ as my IDE.

I used the Java language and the Java Collection Framework.

* Java Programming Language - GeeksForGeeks (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java/)

# Future Work

* Score the game according to the actual rules
* Remove cards from the deck as they are drawn, reshuffle if they run out
* Save high scores to a file on the user's computer
